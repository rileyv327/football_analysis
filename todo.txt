Finish setting up base player + gk + ball + ref detection. 

Things to add:
- Could probably train it to identify the lines which would give really easy insight into locations + camera blur? 

Next Steps:

- Small clips of data --> Fouls --> Interesting way to self-fund (Socail media)

-- Feed another dimension of frames? Why wouldn't you be able to train on stitched footage? Especially if you're still limiting it to boxes?



I guess at that point you're just working with frames of boxes.


But should that be post-processing?

Ball meets player and stops? Bc this guy got location data working to some degree. Or at least veloctiy. 

- Ball interpolation meets player. But it would prob have to be high threshold unless you're clever about it.

- Start and end are the most important frames. 

------ If start_frame_trigger then look for end_frame_trigger and save what's inbetween. 
------ Shots that go in could be easy. 
------------------Easy marketing: BEST SHOOTERS MOST COMMON SHOT; Video out. Twitter bot could literally pull highlights. 

Saves, same concept. 

Really accurate pass tracking.
